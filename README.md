# NBA Fantasy Draft Tool for the Sleeper Platform
Hello I got tired of manually finding the best "steals" and underrated players in fantasy basketball. So I made this tool. It uses the default sleeper scoring system. Just provide your draftID found like 
- https://sleeper.com/draft/nba/DRAFT_ID_IS_THIS
As well as the number of teams in your league, and your draft #.

# Features
See what your pick #'s are so you can begin to "scope" out a player for your rounds pick.
Sort to see players by their :
- average sleeper score
- average of their highest sleeper weekly game score
- average of their 2 highest sleeper weekly game scores


## Uses my basketball-reference chrome extension
This [extension](https://github.com/brianminsong) that I made was used to get a more "accurate" rating of players.
